# **FINTECH NETCENTS CASE STUDY REPORT** 
![Logo](netcents_technology_inc_logo.jpg)
## **Introduction**

* The world is constantly changing, and it appears that some cycles in the disruption, adaptation, and expansion processes that human beings go through leave a higher imprint in our memories, experiences, and therefore the ways we act in response to those changes get a hard look, we ask the hard questions, we conduct research studies to bring about the data that can be used to answer questions to disruption in cycles that "We used to know", and we can either willingly make a choice to reinvent ourselves, and choose to participate of the process of change, adaptation, and learning that the unknown may bring about, and with that opportunities, as well as setbacks. The alternative is to be surprised by the changing event, and not be an active participant of the change suddenly imposed on us. No time to prepare, and no time to plan, we are only left with the choice to carry about what the new cycle will bring about. 

* I wanted to begin this case study report with these introductory lines that describes what the world of FINTECH is all about: CHANGE. In my introduction, I talked about cycles that we go through that have forever changed our patterns, vision, and therefore destiny (in the grand scheme of things). From the discovery of fire and the rise of men in the Stone ages, the rise of the human existence in the steel ages, the first technological innovations across history and their evolution to what the world in 2023 is all about have occurred in slow, but disruptive, and one thing have been proven throughout these years :"We never go back to what he used to know"

* Iam really happy to write about a company in this case study report that I came across almost by accident. I had began learning to trade some cryptocurrencies when the economy disrupted dramatically, and changed our lives in all its dimensions: Covid 2020. At the time like many people, I was eager to want to learn a new skill, something I could do online, something that I could work on to bring myself some passive income. A friend of mine told me about a trading course lead by some experienced old school traders that had been trading stocks since the 80's, as well as a merchant account provider whom became really wealthy offering merchant accounts, and payment processing services to business with visa, and mastercard. By the end of 2021, the trading academy teamed up with a company that had "whitelabeled" their platform to them to offer customers, and businesses payment processing services to begin accepting cryptocurrencies as payment. The "whitelabeled" platform had changed names. But I went deeper down the rabbit hole about the original company. To my surprise, it was a Canadian Company based in Vancouver, British Columbia. The name of the Company: NETCENTS inc. a Canadian fintech company that offers a range of payment processing solutions to merchants,partners, and users through an entire cryptocurrency ecosystem with full payment integration, with the option of instant settlements, and security while giving users access to over 40 million merchants worldwide.

## **Overview and Origin**

NETCENTS incorporated was founded by founder, and CEO CLAYTON MOORE an exoerienced entrepreneur in the payments industry. In 2003, Clayton had founded a different enterprise named Cybux, an initiative throughout BC with to implement techonological advances in the gift card programs for restaurant chains all over Canada. Clayton decided to sell Cybux, and founded NEtCents in 2006.
> NetCents was based on Clayton's belief that the payment industry was ripe for disruption. Today, NetCents is a the transactional hub for all cryptocurrency payments. 
* Clayton explains in the welcoming website of NETCENTS that his vision was about making payment processes eadier, faster, and stronger, and that one barrier that merchants have is the pain points of not having everything integrated in a platform that is user friendly, so that business owners can focus on running their business mission, instead of figuring out different kinds of tech to carry about payment transactions. I signed up for the investors's bloggers subscription of the company, and in the vision statement of NETCENTS CLayton states:
> The innovative pathway to payment solutions is that businesses should have the freedom to choose, not be frustrated with wait times, fees or have to go to 4 different places to do the same thing: pay. Building a universal cryptocurrency payments infrastructure that optimizes secure payments, through a user-friendly, developer friendly, and tech-illiterate friendly platform. 


## **Business activities**

* NETCENTS aimes to resolve the multiple different pain points that the current payment processors for small businesses, large enterprises, and multiple users have nowadays that hasn't quite resolved, but thanks to the revolutionary discovery of bitcoin, the mother cryptocurrency created by Satoshi Nakamoto that opened up the pandora box of conversations about what money is, where it is the money comes from, how in our past did we come to use the fiat standard such as the CAD dollar in Canada, or the EURO in Europe. For NETCENTS, the payment processing journey from wait times, chargebacks, over the top fees charged to the merchant by large enterprises such as VISA, and MASTERCARd to name a few. The answer is simple: A small business, a large business, an e-commerce business can begin accepting cryptocurrencies where the merchants get instant settlement. Bitcoin is known to be the smarter, harder, sound money with fixed supply that has proven to be the best performing digital asset in the last 10 years. NETCENTS empowers business owners to think about money as the tool to allow us to bring value to others through competition, and innovation. If there is competition, then companies strive to be better. A long term approach to the inflation problem many businesses still deal with since the pandemic. Payment solutions to merchants proved to be not reliable, not secure, not sophisticated enough to withstand the impact it had. 

* NETCENTS operates in a highly competitive market, with several established players such as PayPal, Square, and Stripe. However, the company has been able to differentiate itself by offering a range of payment solutions, by becoming the hub for cryptocurrency payments, which sets it apart from its competitors. 
* NetCents has shown impressive growth since its inception. The company's revenue has been increasing steadily, and it has expanded its customer base significantly. As of 2022, NetCents has over 500,000 registered users and has processed over $1 billion in transactions. The company has also raised $15 million in funding, which it plans to use to further develop its payment processing platform and expand its reach in the market.

## **Landscape**

* Being a Fintech company NetCents's belief that the payments were outdated, too complicated, and far too costly for merchants. As Bitcoin began to gain traction in 2017, NetCents ceased all traditional payment processing and pivoted, focusing 100% on cryptocurrency. NetCents eliminates the friction of transacting with cryptocurrency and offers an entire cryptocurrency ecosystem providing full payment integration, Instant Settlements, and security while providing consumers access to over 40 million merchants, worldwide.

* The Company is currently onboarding merchants as quickly as possible with the expectation of growth created by the long term trends in the industry.
* Because NetCents software is already installed but "dormant" on millions of terminals, terminal companies would not choose an alternative provider of cryptocurrency payments for merchants using their hardware, hence "trojan horse".

## **Recommendations**

* When I learned about the different options that NETCENTS have for business owners, and therefore encouraging customers to adopt cryptocurrencies to make these payments, it occured to me that maybe a customer that love a particular small business, or a digital store could serve as an embassador of NETCENTS by referring my favorite business to NETCENTS, if I referred businesses to begin embodying the concept of the free market, hard money, sound money, the value of the long term hold that a currency like bitcoin has, the power of technology, and the blockchain applications being built on these blockchains. Then NETCENTS could pay me a commission for business referall, me as the customer would then become a partner of NETCENTS, but also a bridge, to the relationship where the customer, the merchant, and the medium through where the transaction interact with one another in a platform has integration for it all. This became a reality 2 years ago. NETCENTS has now partnered up with users, and there is a huge community that talk about the world of crypto, the world of technology, the world of Fintech.
